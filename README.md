# wan-ranger
This tool was build to make IP-host discovery faster
it is using multiprocessing to create multiple threads to check all 254 Hosts of a C-Type Network at once.

# how to use
python3 wanranger.py (IP range -> example: 10.0.1.) (Save to file? yes/no)

# requirements

The project tries to install the required packages itself.
If this doesn't work then you need to install multiprocessing & termcolor manually using pip
